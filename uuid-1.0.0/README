  OSSP uuid - Universally Unique Identifier
  Version 1.0.0 (16-Feb-2004)

  ABSTRACT

  OSSP uuid is a ISO-C application programming interface (API) and
  corresponding command line interface (CLI) for the generation of DCE
  1.1 and ISO/IEC 11578:1996 compliant Universally Unique Identifier
  (UUID). It supports DCE 1.1 variant UUIDs of version 1 (time and node
  based), version 3 (name based) and version 4 (random number based).

  UUIDs are 128 bit numbers which are intended to have a high likelihood
  of uniqueness over space and time and are computationally difficult
  to guess. They are globally unique identifiers which can be locally
  generated without contacting a global registration authority. UUIDs
  are intended as unique identifiers for both mass tagging objects
  with an extremely short lifetime and to reliably identifying very
  persistent objects across a network.
